## 1. What is the **devrel.directory**?

The **devrel.directory** is a centralized knowledge base built on the [Fumadocs](https://github.com/fuma-nama/fumadocs) framework. 
Our mission is to provide a one-stop resource that empowers anyone to learn about Developer Relations and break into the field, both for beginners and seasoned professionals looking to deepen their knowledge.

### The Origin Story

The idea for DevRel Directory emerged from a common challenge many of us face: the scattered nature of DevRel resources across the internet. While conducting research for a metrics and KPI study, it became apparent that getting started in DevRel can be very overwhelming. 
Many professionals maintain their own GitHub repositories with curated links, blog lists, video bookmarks, and job postings. Initiatives like [DevRel University](https://devreluni.com/) also exist. However, there wasn't a centralized, community-driven platform serving as a comprehensive resource for both newcomers and experienced professionals.
This is why I decided to build **devrel.directory**.

### The Mission

The **devrel.directory** is a public good, an open-source project that is maintained **by the community, for the community**.
