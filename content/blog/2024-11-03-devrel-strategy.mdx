## So, DevRel Strategy?

This is a comprehensive guide to creating and implementing effective Developer Relations strategies.
We've been covering DevRel Strategy in our [Fundamentals](docs/fundamentals/devrel-strategy) section. This post will also use the OKR(A) framework to measure success. You can read more about it [here](/blog/2024-10-29-devrel-team-goal-planning-strategy-okr).

<Callout>
  A well-crafted DevRel strategy is the foundation for building strong relationships between your company and the developer community, driving adoption, and fostering innovation.
</Callout>

Having a well defined strategy, ways to measure it's impact and iterate on it is key to success.

Without a plan in place, you're just shooting in the dark. We don't want that.

## What is a 'DevRel Strategy'?

There is no one definition of what a DevRel Strategy is.
Instead, it's a collection of activities, initiatives and goals that align with the overall objectives of the Developer Relations team.

A DevRel Strategy is:

<Cards>
  <Card
    icon={<Target className="text-purple-300" />}
    title="A Strategic Plan"
  >
    A comprehensive plan outlining how your company will engage with, support, and grow its developer community - from community building to content creation, aligned with business objectives.
  </Card>

  <Card
    icon={<Edit className="text-blue-300" />}
    title="A Living Document"
  >
    Your strategy evolves as your community grows. Regular reporting and adaptation are crucial, using metrics and community feedback to continuously refine your approach.
  </Card>

  <Card

    Provides structure through clear objectives, audience understanding, journey mapping, community approach, content strategy, feedback loops, and measurable KPIs.
  </Card>
</Cards>

Great, now we know what a DevRel Strategy is we can start to think about how to create one.

## The Beginning: Where are we?

### Understanding Where DevRel Sits

Before defining objectives, it's crucial to understand where DevRel sits within your organization. Based on my survey of 30 companies and protocols acting in crypto, web3 and AI, the organizational placement varies significantly:

export const chartDataDevRelCenter= [
  { key: "Marketing", val: 32.1 },
  { key: "Engineering", val: 32.1 },
  { key: "Product Management", val: 14.3 },
  { key: "Own Department", val: 10.7 },
  { key: "Customer Support", val: 7.1 },
  { key: "Growth", val: 3.6 },
];

<PieChart 
   title="Center of Developer Relations in Organizations"
   description="Where do you primarily see Developer Relations centered in your organization?" 
   chartData={chartDataDevRelCenter}
/>

<p className="text-center italic mt-2">Center of Developer Relations in Organizations</p>

The survey results show an even split between *Marketing* and *Engineering* departments as the primary homes for DevRel teams, followed by *Product Management*. Some organizations have established DevRel as its own independent department, while smaller percentages operate within *Customer Support* and *Growth*. 

<Callout>
This distribution highlights that there's no one-size-fits-all approach - DevRel can thrive in different organizational structures depending on company needs and culture.
</Callout>

But how do you know where to put your DevRel team?\
Here are some questions that can help you decide:

- **Do you have a product that needs to be adopted by developers?**\
Maybe you should put DevRel in Engineering to get the developers to use your product and give them the best possible onboarding and enablement experience. Engineers are the ones who build the product after all. And the

- **Do you have a community that needs to be built and nurtured?**\
Maybe you should put DevRel in Marketing and work on content, community and events.

- **Do you have a need for education and enablement of developers?**\
Maybe you should put DevRel in Product Management to create the best possible onboarding and enablement experience.

- **Do you have a need for evangelism and promotion of your product, protocol or company?**\
Maybe you should put them in Marketing to promote it.

- **Do you have a need for technical support and customer success?**\
Maybe you should put them in Customer Support to provide the best possible support to your developers. 

Remember: This is just a starting point to help you understand where DevRel can sit in the org.
We will cover some of these questions in more detail later. 

--- 

### Primary Focus Areas

Okay, so we know where DevRel sits in the org. Now, what are they doing? If you're someone who's been around DevRel for a while, you'll know that the focus areas vary significantly. Many times the people you're talking to will tell you they do "everything" and it's hard to get them to focus on one thing.
This is what you want to avoid. Make sure to focus on what's important for your product, protocol or company.

My research revealed the primary focus areas of Developer Relations teams and you can tell its very diverse:

export const chartDataDevRelFocus = [
  { key: "Community", val: 20 },
  { key: "Content", val: 16.7 },
  { key: "Developer Experience", val: 16.7 },
  { key: "Product", val: 16.7 },
  { key: "Education", val: 13.3 },
  { key: "Evangelism", val: 6.7 },
  { key: "Open-source", val: 3.3 },
  { key: "Other", val: 6.7 },
];

<PieChart 
   title="Primary Focus of Developer Advocacy in Companies"
   description="Which type of Developer Advocacy does your company primarily focus on?" 
   chartData={chartDataDevRelFocus}
/>

<Accordions >
   <Accordion title="Focus Area Explanation (with Description)">
      | Focus Area | Percentage | Description |
      | --- | --- | --- |
      | Community | 20% | Building and nurturing developer communities |
      | Content | 16.7% | Creating technical documentation, tutorials, and educational materials |
      | Developer Experience | 16.7% | Improving the overall developer journey |
      | Product | 16.7% | Focusing on product adoption and feedback |
      | Education | 13.3% | Training and enabling developers |
      | Evangelism | 6.7% | Promoting platform/product adoption |
      | Open-source | 3.3% | Contributing to and managing open-source initiatives |
      | Other | 6.7% | Holistic approaches combining multiple areas |

      Notably, under the 'Other' category, respondents emphasized the importance of taking a holistic approach. They stressed that all areas are highly important and that focusing solely on one aspect neglects the multifaceted nature of Developer Relations.
   </Accordion>
</Accordions>

Okay, but how do you know what to focus on? 
This is where you need to do your research. It's important to understand your audience, your product, your company and your goals.
You need to speak to both, internal stakeholders and external developers. 

- If you're one of the founding members of the company and there is no product yet, you need to focus on education and community.
- If you're a bit further down the line, you can start to focus on evangelism and product.
- And if you're a mature company with a well established product, you can focus on community and content, content, content.

Usually this is one of the first steps in a 30-60-90 day plan, but we'll cover that in more detail later. 

Now we first need to define our objectives.

---

## Chapter One: The Objective

The objective is the foundation of any DevRel strategy. Without clear objectives, you cannot effectively:
- Move forward with coherent initiatives
- Know what you're working towards
- Hire the right people
- Allocate appropriate budget
- Measure success

Your objectives should be specific, measurable, and aligned with both business goals and developer needs. 
In the following sections we will cover how to define your objectives and how to structure them. Let's start with the strategic side of things:

### Setting Strategic Direction

Set sail! You know where to go, right? Oh you don't? Well...

The strategic direction of your DevRel strategy is crucial. It's obvious, right?
Your DevRel objectives need to address at least the following three key areas. Depending on your specific situation you may need to add others, 
but these are a good starting point and should always be considered because they are essential to your success, growth and impact.

| Area | Objectives |
|------|------------|
| Business Impact | • Revenue growth through increased platform adoption<br/>• Market expansion into new developer segments<br/>• Reduced support costs through self-serve resources |
| Developer Success | • Faster time-to-value for new developers<br/>• Higher satisfaction and productivity<br/>• Stronger community engagement and collaboration |
| Platform Evolution | • Product improvements driven by developer feedback<br/>• Enhanced developer experience and tooling<br/>• New use cases and implementations |

Now that we know at least where to go, let's talk about how to get there, which route to take and how long it will take:

### Planning Horizons

Structure your objectives across multiple timeframes. When working on your objectives, you should always consider the impact to later stages.
Try to avoid setting objectives that are too short-term, as this can lead to a **lack of long-term vision**. You don't want to end up with a mess of initiatives that don't align with each other.
But also avoid setting objectives that are too long-term; on the other hand this can lead to a **lack of focus and impact**.

Ah, and btw: **Don't be afraid to pivot!**. If there is one thing I've learned in my career, it's that you need to be flexible and adapt to the situation if something isn't working. If you're not, you'll not move forward. 
You'll lose momentum. You need to be laser focused and can't afford to be distracted by trying to fix what isn't working in the first place.

Let's take a look at some examples. Take these with a grain of salt, they are just meant to give you an idea of how you can structure your objectives. It's important to note that the timeframe can vary significantly depending on your specific situation:

| Timeframe | Objectives |
|-----------|------------|
| **Short-term (0-3 months)** | • Establish baseline metrics and KPIs<br/>• Launch MVP documentation and essential guides<br/>• Set up basic community channels and support<br/>• Create initial "time-to-hello-world" content |
| **Medium-term (3-6 months)** | • Scale developer adoption with targeted programs<br/>• Expand technical content and learning resources<br/>• Build feedback loops with product teams<br/>• Launch developer champions program |
| **Long-term (6-12 months)** | • Create sustainable developer ecosystem<br/>• Drive platform innovation through community feedback<br/>• Establish thought leadership in specific verticals<br/>• Scale successful programs based on metrics |

<Callout type="warn">
In rapidly evolving spaces like crypto, web3, and AI, planning beyond 12 months can be counterproductive. Focus on shorter cycles with frequent reassessment and adjustment of objectives.
</Callout>

### Critical Success Factors

To achieve these objectives, focus on:

#### 1. **Clear Value Proposition**

Your value proposition is the foundation of your DevRel strategy. It's what makes developers want to use your platform, engage with your content, and ultimately become advocates for your product. Without a compelling value prop, you're just another voice in the crowd - and trust me, that crowd is getting louder every day.
Let's break down how to craft a value proposition that actually resonates with developers (and no, "we're the best platform ever" doesn't count). Here's what you need to focus on:

<ImageZoom  
alt="Value Proposition" 
width={400}
height={400}
src={ValueProposition}
className="!my-0 rounded-xl bg-fd-background"
priority
/>
*Value Proposition based on the DevRel Book*

| Focus Area | Key Activities |
|------------|---------------|
| **Articulate Unique Benefits** | • Identify and communicate specific pain points your solution addresses<br/>• Highlight time-saving and efficiency gains<br/>• Demonstrate how your platform/product enhances developer workflow<br/>• Show clear examples of successful implementations<br/>• Provide concrete "before and after" scenarios |
| **Demonstrate ROI** | • Calculate and present cost savings metrics<br/>• Showcase development time reduction<br/>• Highlight resource optimization benefits<br/>• Present case studies with quantifiable results<br/>• Track and report on key performance indicators |
| **Define Success Metrics** | • Set clear adoption metrics and goals<br/>• Establish developer satisfaction benchmarks<br/>• Define engagement KPIs (e.g., active users, API calls)<br/>• Create timeline-based objectives<br/>• Implement feedback loops for continuous improvement |

<Callout>
Remember: Your value proposition should be data-driven and focused on tangible outcomes. As the DevRelBook states: "Data beats fluff" - back up your claims with real metrics and success stories.
</Callout>

#### 2. **Strong Foundations**

Strong foundations are like the bedrock of your DevRel strategy. Without solid documentation, reliable support, and quality educational resources, even the best value proposition will crumble. 
Think of it as building a house - you wouldn't start with the roof, would you? Let's break down what makes for truly robust DevRel foundations.
Here's a detailed look at the key components that will keep your developer relations program standing tall:

<PieChart
  title="Developer Tools & Services Distribution"
  description="What companies offer to developers based on survey data"
  chartData={[
    { key: "Documentation", val: 76.7 },
    { key: "Code Samples", val: 70.0 },
    { key: "APIs", val: 56.7 },
    { key: "SDKs", val: 53.3 },
    { key: "Platforms/BaaS", val: 46.7 },
    { key: "Libraries/Frameworks", val: 43.3 },
    { key: "IDEs", val: 13.3 },
    { key: "Other", val: 10.0 }
  ]}
/>

Based on my research, documentation and code samples are the clear winners here - making up over 70% of what companies offer to developers. 
What's the first thing we all do when checking out a new tool? We hit the docs! APIs and SDKs follow closely behind, showing how companies are really focusing on making their tools developer-friendly.
But it's not just about having them, it's about having them in the right format and making them easily accessible. More on that later.

Here are the key activities you should focus on to build strong foundations:

| Focus Area | Key Activities |
|------------|---------------|
| **Documentation & Tools** | • Create comprehensive API reference docs<br/>• Build developer SDKs and libraries<br/>• Provide code samples and starter templates<br/>• Maintain interactive API playground<br/>• Implement documentation versioning |
| **Support Infrastructure** | • Set up developer forums and communities<br/>• Establish ticketing/issue tracking system<br/>• Create knowledge base and FAQs<br/>• Provide direct support channels<br/>• Monitor support response times |
| **Educational Resources** | • Develop interactive tutorials and guides<br/>• Create video content and webinars<br/>• Write technical blog posts and articles<br/>• Design hands-on workshops<br/>• Build learning paths for different skill levels |

####  3. **Community Investment**

The community is the heart of any DevRel program. It's where developers come to learn, share, and collaborate. 
This is also one of the hardest things to get right, but when done well, it can be a powerful driver for growth and success.
Often times you'll hear 'yeah, we just need to build a community' - but it's not that simple. 
You need to invest in it, you need to nurture it, you need to have a plan for it - and you need to have TIME for it. So carve out time to engage with your community.

| Focus Area | Key Activities |
|------------|---------------|
| **Community Building** | • Foster peer-to-peer learning opportunities<br/>• Create mentorship programs<br/>• Host community events and meetups<br/>• Facilitate knowledge sharing sessions<br/>• Build online discussion spaces |
| **Recognition Programs** | • Implement contributor rewards system<br/>• Highlight community success stories<br/>• Create developer advocacy programs<br/>• Provide speaking opportunities<br/>• Offer exclusive access to beta features |
| **Collaboration Tools** | • Set up community forums<br/>• Enable project collaboration spaces<br/>• Create networking opportunities<br/>• Organize hackathons<br/>• Facilitate code review sessions |

####  4. **Continuous Improvement**

DevRel is all about continuous improvement - you can't just set it and forget it. You need to constantly gather feedback, measure your impact, and adapt your approach based on what you learn.
This is where having good tracking and measurement systems in place becomes crucial. Let's break down the key areas. We will cover this in more detail later.

| Focus Area | Key Activities |
|------------|---------------|
| **Feedback Loops** | • Conduct regular developer surveys<br/>• Host feedback sessions and interviews<br/>• Monitor community discussions<br/>• Track support tickets and issues<br/>• Analyze documentation usage patterns |
| **Metrics & Analytics** | • Track developer adoption metrics<br/>• Measure documentation effectiveness<br/>• Monitor community engagement<br/>• Analyze support response times<br/>• Review developer satisfaction scores |
| **Program Optimization** | • Iterate on documentation based on feedback<br/>• Refine community programs<br/>• Adjust support processes<br/>• Update educational content<br/>• Enhance developer tools |

### Setting Clear Objectives

Now that we've covered how to understand where DevRel sits in the org and what the primary focus areas are, we can define our objectives.
Your DevRel objectives should align with your **company's overall goals** while serving the **developer community**. 

When setting objectives, we can leverage both strategic and tactical frameworks. At a strategic level, **OKRs** help us set ambitious goals, while **SMART** criteria ensure our tactical execution is well-defined.

<Cards>
   <Card title="Objectives" icon={<Target className="text-purple-300" />}>
      Set ambitious, inspirational goals that align with your company's mission and the developer community's needs.
   </Card>
   <Card title="Key Results" icon={<ChartLine className="text-purple-300" />}>
      Define measurable outcomes that will indicate progress toward your objectives.
   </Card>
</Cards>

For tactical execution, let's break down the SMART framework:\
*Let's sing a [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG3UwIDAEb8)*

<Steps>
   <Step>
      #### S is for *Specific*
      Your objective should be specific and clear. It should not be vague or general.
   </Step>
   <Step>
      #### M is for *Measurable*
      Your objective should be measurable. You should be able to track and measure your progress towards the objective.
   </Step>
   <Step>
      #### A is for *Achievable*
      Your objective should be achievable. You should be able to achieve the objective with the resources and capabilities available to you.
   </Step>
   <Step>
      #### R is for *Relevant*
      Your objective should be relevant. It should align with your company's overall goals and the needs of the developer community.
   </Step>
   <Step>
      #### T is for *Time-bound*
      Your objective should have a deadline. You should know when you want to achieve the objective by.
   </Step>
</Steps>

### Defining Your Objectives

With our understanding of SMART objectives and the OKRA framework, let's explore the key strategic questions that will help shape your specific objectives. These questions ensure your objectives are both impactful and achievable:

1. **Company Alignment**
   - How does this objective support the company's current strategic priorities?
   - What specific business metrics will this objective impact?
   - Which stakeholders need to be involved or consulted?
   - How does this align with other departmental goals?

2. **Developer Impact**
   - What tangible benefits will developers gain?
   - How will this improve their workflow or productivity?
   - What pain points are we specifically addressing?
   - How can we validate the impact through both qualitative and quantitative metrics?

3. **Resource Planning**
   - What team capabilities are needed to achieve this objective?
   - What tools or infrastructure must be in place?
   - What timeline is realistic given current resources?
   - What dependencies need to be considered?

<Callout>
Pro tip: Start with 2-3 core objectives rather than trying to tackle everything at once. You can always expand your focus as your program matures and you demonstrate success.
</Callout>

---

### Example Objectives

Let's look at some example strategic objectives for a Developer Relations program. Remember that your specific objectives should align with your company's stage, resources, and goals.
Focus on IMPACTFUL objectives first, expand scope later.


Here are some example strategic objectives across different focus areas:

| Strategic Area | Example Objectives |
|----------------|-------------------|
| **Developer Experience** | • Create a seamless onboarding experience that gets developers to their first success quickly<br/>• Build comprehensive, well-organized documentation and learning resources<br/>• Establish reliable support channels and response processes |
| **Community Building** | • Foster an active, engaged developer community where peers help peers<br/>• Create opportunities for developers to showcase their work and expertise<br/>• Develop programs that recognize and reward community contributors |
| **Product Feedback** | • Build strong feedback loops between developers and product teams<br/>• Ensure developer needs influence product roadmap decisions<br/>• Create channels for early testing and validation of new features |
| **Education & Enablement** | • Develop clear learning paths for different developer segments<br/>• Create content that helps developers solve real-world problems<br/>• Enable developers to become product experts and advocates |

<Callout>
Remember: Your objectives should align with both business goals and developer needs. Start with 2-3 core objectives rather than trying to tackle everything at once. You can expand your focus as your program matures.
</Callout>

These strategic objectives provide direction for your DevRel program. Later in this article, we'll cover how to measure progress against these objectives using the OKRA framework and specific metrics.

![Developer Audience](/images/blog/2024-11-03-devrel-strategy/developer-audience.jpg)
## Chapter Two: Understanding Your Developer Audience

<Callout>
"There is no simple single definition for 'Developer.' Rather, it refers to millions of people with differing skill levels and authority, who use different technology stacks and programming languages." - DevRel Book
</Callout>

One of the most common pitfalls in DevRel is saying you're "targeting developers" without further specification. This approach is too broad to be effective. Your developer audience is diverse across multiple dimensions:

- Skill levels and authority
- Technology stacks and programming languages
- Geographic regions and languages
- Company types and sizes
- Career stages
- Use cases and needs

#### Developer Segmentation Framework

To effectively understand and target your developer audience, you need a structured approach to segmentation. The framework consists of four key filters:

1. **Technical (Product Focus)**
   - Which programming languages do they use?
   - What technology stack do they work with?
   - What platforms do they develop for?
   - What technical requirements must they meet?

2. **User (Developer Focus)**
   - What is their experience level?
   - What is their decision-making authority?
   - What are their primary responsibilities?
   - What are their technical preferences?

3. **Organization (Customer Focus)**
   - What type of company do they work for?
   - What industry are they in?
   - What is their company's size and stage?
   - What are their use cases?

4. **Market (Industry/Geography Focus)**
   - Which geographic regions are they in?
   - What languages do they speak?
   - What industry regulations affect them?
   - What market trends influence their work?

#### Validation Criteria

When defining your segments, each criterion must pass these tests:

1. Is the segment relevant to our business?
2. Is it a large enough segment?
3. Is it a valuable enough segment?
4. Can we target this segment with our current resources?

<Callout type="warning">
"Segmentation is not a one-time exercise. To start, it's most important to focus on your current situation over the next 6 to 12 months. However, what's important today may change in the future." - Caroline Lewko & James Parton, DevRel Book
</Callout>

#### Creating Developer Personas

As Tessa Kriesel notes, "Personas are a way to personalize your targets and humanize them. Depending on your segments, you should define 2-4 personas."

<ImageZoom  
alt="Developer Persona Canvas Example" 
width={400}
height={400}
src={DeveloperCanvas}
className="!my-0 rounded-xl bg-fd-background"
priority
/>
*Developer Persona Canvas Example*

Each persona should include:

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Background Information** | • Role and responsibilities<br/>• Years of experience<br/>• Primary technologies used<br/>• Career goals |
| **Technical Profile** | • Preferred programming languages<br/>• Development environment<br/> Technical decision-making authority<br/>• Tool preferences |
| **Behavioral Patterns** | • How they learn new technologies<br/>• Where they seek information<br/>• Community participation habits<br/>• Decision-making process |
| **Pain Points and Needs** | • Current challenges<br/>• Technical limitations<br/>• Resource constraints<br/>• Learning preferences |


(download the blank template [here](/images/blog/2024-11-03-devrel-strategy/developer-persona-canvas.png). Thanks to [DevRel Book](https://www.devrelbook.com/))

#### Developer Positioning

Once you understand your audience, you need to position your product or platform effectively. Answer these key questions:

1. **Value Proposition**
   - What type of product are you offering?
   - What specific problems does it solve?
   - How does it make a developer's life easier?

2. **Differentiation**
   - Why should developers choose your solution?
   - What makes your offering unique?
   - How does it compare to alternatives?

3. **Success Criteria**
   - What does success look like for the developer?
   - How can you help them achieve their goals?
   - What metrics matter to them?

<Callout>
Remember: Your audience understanding should directly inform your content strategy, community approach, and success metrics. Regular reassessment is crucial as developer needs and market conditions evolve.

### Example OKRs

Based on the OKRA framework, here are examples of DevRel objectives with SMART key results. Please note that these are just examples, and you should adjust them to your specific situation. It doesn't make sense to work on SDK adoption if your SDK is just a simple wrapper around an API.
Wait, I need to zoom in a little for this one 🔎:
<div className="text-2xl font-bold text-center my-6 p-4 bg-blue-100 dark:bg-blue-900 rounded-lg">
  Focus on IMPACTFUL activities first, polish the rest later.

<Callout>
Remember: Your OKRs should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) and directly tied to both business outcomes and developer success. Use the [OKRA Framework](/blog/2024-10-29-devrel-team-goal-planning-strategy-okr) to define clear metrics, actions, and timelines for each objective.
</Callout>

By setting clear objectives that align with both company goals and developer needs, you create a foundation for a successful DevRel strategy that delivers measurable value to all stakeholders. The key is to balance lead metrics (measuring work output) and lag metrics (measuring outcomes) based on your team composition and organizational structure.


    - OKR(A) framework
        - If you notice constantly lagging/red metrics, you need to ask yourself why and adjust your strategy accordingly asap. Do not hesitate to pivot.

## Questions from the community

- Building engaged developer communities
- How do you find people that are smart devs, but excited to sell as well

- choosing metrics (set up ones expected to be be different from operational ones)
- hiring (roles, and in what order, and what seniority levels)
- where does devrel sit within the org structure (how to pick a function/ reporting line)
- securing budget (and how to convince that devrel activities are important enough)

Also, if I may speak on behalf of DevRel Uni (cc @bianca_buzea) :
- 30-60-90 day plan

## Zero to one: DevRel in 365 days.

example: 
- "Creating an LLM-as-a-Judge That Drives Business Results (51 minute read)" https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/llm-judge/
### Prerequisites

- No DevRel team
- No DevRel budget
- No DevRel plan
- An empty sheet of paper

### Milestones
*
Possible key milestones:

- 1. Content and Education Hub
    - A comprehensive documentation portal covering all the topics a developer would need to know about the product with clear learning paths.
    - A regular content calendar (2-3 quality posts per week) with a mix of tutorials, how-to guides, reference material and more:
        - Deep-dive tutorials
        - How-to guides
        - Case studies of successful implementations
        - Technical best practises and architecture guides
- 2. Active Developer Community
    - A thriving Discord or similar community platform with: 
        - Regular technical offics hours
        - Active peer-to-peer support channels
        - Direct access to the technical team for advanced questions
    - A 'developer champions' program recognizing and rewarding active community contributors. You want to keep your superstars.
- 3. Feedback & Product Development
    - Established feedback loops between developers and the product team.
    - Monthly developer advisory sessions and ways to harvest actionable (!) feedback.
    - A public roadmap influenced by community input. (This is a great way to get developers excited about your product. Make them a part of the process.)
    - Regular beta testing programs for new features (For your superstars)
- 4. Measurable Impact 
    - A working OKR(A) framework in place to measure success.
        - Including factors like 'lagging' and 'leading' metrics to understand the impact of your efforts. You want to rigorously work towards keeping the metrics in the green.
        If you notice constantly lagging/red metrics, you need to ask yourself why and adjust your strategy accordingly asap. Do not hesitate to pivot.
    - Clear KPIs showing:
        - Growth in monthly active developers
        - Increased documentation usage and satisfaction
            - Have tracking metrics in place to measure bounce rates, time spent on page, number of SDK uses, etc.
                - If you see a lot of bounce rates, you need to ask yourself why and adjust your docs. (heat maps will help you here)
        - Higher developer retention
            - Have tracking metrics in place to measure churn rate, number of churned users, etc. (You could even track where the contributors went via their GH profiles.)
        - Improved time-to-hello-world metrics
        - Community engagement metrics
            - Number of comments, number of reactions, number of posts, etc.
- 5. Industry presence 
    - Regular contributions to industry publications
    - Regular speaking engagements
    - Hosting or sponsoring developer events 

The key to achieving this vision will be maintaining a balance between educational content creation, community building, and gathering actionable feedback for our product team. 
Everything will be measured against clear OKRs to ensure we're delivering value both to our developer community and to our company.
