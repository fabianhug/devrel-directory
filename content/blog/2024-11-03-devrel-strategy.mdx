## So, DevRel Strategy?

This is a comprehensive guide to creating and implementing effective Developer Relations strategies.
We've been covering DevRel Strategy in our [Fundamentals](docs/fundamentals/devrel-strategy) section. This post will also use the OKR(A) framework to measure success. You can read more about it [here](/blog/2024-10-29-devrel-team-goal-planning-strategy-okr).

<Callout>
  A well-crafted DevRel strategy is the foundation for building strong relationships between your company and the developer community, driving adoption, and fostering innovation.
</Callout>

Having a well defined strategy, ways to measure it's impact and iterate on it is key to success.

Without a plan in place, you're just shooting in the dark. We don't want that.

## What is a 'DevRel Strategy'?

There is no one definition of what a DevRel Strategy is.
Instead, it's a collection of activities, initiatives and goals that align with the overall objectives of the Developer Relations team.

A DevRel Strategy is:

<Cards>
  <Card
    icon={<Target className="text-purple-300" />}
    title="A Strategic Plan"
  >
    A comprehensive plan outlining how your company will engage with, support, and grow its developer community - from community building to content creation, aligned with business objectives.
  </Card>

  <Card
    icon={<Edit className="text-blue-300" />}
    title="A Living Document"
  >
    Your strategy evolves as your community grows. Regular reporting and adaptation are crucial, using metrics and community feedback to continuously refine your approach.
  </Card>

  <Card
    icon={<Code className="text-green-300" />}
    title="A Clear Roadmap"
  >
    Maps out specific programs like developer advocacy, hackathons, technical workshops, open-source contributions, and recognition programs to achieve your DevRel objectives.
  </Card>

  <Card
    icon={<Lightbulb className="text-yellow-300" />}
    title="A Success Framework"
  >
    Provides structure through clear objectives, audience understanding, journey mapping, community approach, content strategy, feedback loops, and measurable KPIs.
  </Card>
</Cards>

Great, now we know what a DevRel Strategy is we can start to think about how to create one.

### 1. Objective

The objective is the foundation of any DevRel strategy. Without clear objectives, you cannot effectively:
- Move forward with coherent initiatives
- Know what you're working towards
- Hire the right people
- Allocate appropriate budget
- Measure success

#### 1.1 Understanding Where DevRel Sits

Before defining objectives, it's crucial to understand where DevRel sits within your organization. Based on my survey of 30 DevRel professionals in crypto and web3, the organizational placement varies significantly:

export const chartDataDevRelCenter= [
  { key: "Marketing", val: 32.1 },
  { key: "Engineering", val: 32.1 },
  { key: "Product Management", val: 14.3 },
  { key: "Own Department", val: 10.7 },
  { key: "Customer Support", val: 7.1 },
  { key: "Growth", val: 3.6 },
];

<PieChart 
   title="Center of Developer Relations in Organizations"
   description="Where do you primarily see Developer Relations centered in your organization?" 
   chartData={chartDataDevRelCenter}
/>

<p className="text-center italic mt-2">Center of Developer Relations in Organizations</p>

The survey results show an even split between *Marketing* and *Engineering* departments as the primary homes for DevRel teams, followed by *Product Management*. Some organizations have established DevRel as its own independent department, while smaller percentages operate within *Customer Support* and *Growth*. 

<Callout>
This distribution highlights that there's no one-size-fits-all approach - DevRel can thrive in different organizational structures depending on company needs and culture.
</Callout>

--- 

#### 1.2 Primary Focus Areas

Okay, so we know where DevRel sits in the org. Now, what are they doing? If you're someone who's been around DevRel for a while, you'll know that the focus areas vary significantly. Many times the people you're talking to will tell you they do "everything" and it's hard to get them to focus on one thing.
This is what you want to avoid. Make sure to focus on what's important for your product, protocol or company.

My research revealed the primary focus areas of Developer Relations teams and you can tell its very diverse:

export const chartDataDevRelFocus = [
  { key: "Community", val: 20 },
  { key: "Content", val: 16.7 },
  { key: "Developer Experience", val: 16.7 },
  { key: "Product", val: 16.7 },
  { key: "Education", val: 13.3 },
  { key: "Evangelism", val: 6.7 },
  { key: "Open-source", val: 3.3 },
  { key: "Other", val: 6.7 },
];

<PieChart 
   title="Primary Focus of Developer Advocacy in Companies"
   description="Which type of Developer Advocacy does your company primarily focus on?" 
   chartData={chartDataDevRelFocus}
/>

<Accordions >
   <Accordion title="Focus Area Explanation (with Description)">
      | Focus Area | Percentage | Description |
      | --- | --- | --- |
      | Community | 20% | Building and nurturing developer communities |
      | Content | 16.7% | Creating technical documentation, tutorials, and educational materials |
      | Developer Experience | 16.7% | Improving the overall developer journey |
      | Product | 16.7% | Focusing on product adoption and feedback |
      | Education | 13.3% | Training and enabling developers |
      | Evangelism | 6.7% | Promoting platform/product adoption |
      | Open-source | 3.3% | Contributing to and managing open-source initiatives |
      | Other | 6.7% | Holistic approaches combining multiple areas |

      Notably, under the 'Other' category, respondents emphasized the importance of taking a holistic approach. They stressed that all areas are highly important and that focusing solely on one aspect neglects the multifaceted nature of Developer Relations.
   </Accordion>
</Accordions>

Okay, but how do you know what to focus on? 
This is where you need to do your research. It's important to understand your audience, your product, your company and your goals.
You need to speak to both, internal stakeholders and external developers. 

- If you're one of the founding members of the company and there is no product yet, you need to focus on education and community.
- If you're a bit further down the line, you can start to focus on evangelism and product.
- And if you're a mature company with a well established product, you can focus on community and content, content, content.

Usually this is one of the first steps in a 30-60-90 day plan, but we'll cover that in more detail later. 

Now we first need to define our objectives.

--- 

#### 1.3 Setting Clear Objectives

Now that we've covered how to understand where DevRel sits in the org and what the primary focus areas are, we can define our objectives.
Your DevRel objectives should align with your company's overall goals while serving the developer community. 
They should be SMART: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound. 

Let's sing a [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG3UwIDAEb8):

<Steps>
   <Step>
      ### S is for *Specific*
      Your objective should be specific and clear. It should not be vague or general.
   </Step>
   <Step>
      ### M is for *Measurable*
      Your objective should be measurable. You should be able to track and measure your progress towards the objective.
   </Step>
   <Step>
      ### A is for *Achievable*
      Your objective should be achievable. You should be able to achieve the objective with the resources and capabilities available to you.
   </Step>
   <Step>
      ### R is for *Relevant*
      Your objective should be relevant. It should align with your company's overall goals and the needs of the developer community.
   </Step>
   <Step>
      ### T is for *Time-bound*
      Your objective should have a deadline. You should know when you want to achieve the objective by.
   </Step>
</Steps>

Okay, now we know what **SMART** objectives are, let's dive into how to define them.
Here are key questions to consider when defining objectives:

1. **Company Alignment**
   - What are your company's current priorities?
   - How can DevRel support these broader business goals? 
   - What specific challenges can DevRel help solve?
   - Which organizational metrics should DevRel's KRs roll up into?

2. **Developer Value**
   - What value will your program bring to developers?
   - What problems are you solving for your developer community?
   - How will you measure developer success?
   - What mix of lead vs lag metrics will you use?

3. **Program Purpose**
   - What is the primary purpose of your developer program?
   - What specific outcomes do you want to achieve?
   - How will you measure program success?
   - Which DevRel sub-functions will own which metrics?

---

#### 1.4 Example Objectives

Based on the OKRA framework, here are example DevRel objectives with SMART key results. Please note that these are just examples and you should adjust them to your specific situation. It doesn't make sense to work on SDK adoption if your SDK is just a simple wrapper around an API. 

Wait, I need to zoom in a little for this one 🔎:
<div className="text-2xl font-bold text-center my-6 p-4 bg-blue-100 dark:bg-blue-900 rounded-lg">
  Focus on IMPACTFUL activities first, polish the rest later.
</div>

Okay, cool. You get the point. Now back to the examples:

| Objective | Key Results |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Ecosystem Growth** | • Increase developer community members from 1,000 to 5,000 by Q4 2024<br/>• Grow monthly active developers from 100 to 500 by Q3 2024<br/>• Launch developer advocacy program with 10 advocates by Q2 2024 |
| **Internal Advocacy** | • Establish monthly product feedback sessions with 80% engineering team attendance<br/>• Create developer sentiment dashboard tracking NPS with baseline of 30<br/>• Submit 20 validated developer-driven feature requests to product team per quarter |
| **Developer Success** | • Reduce average time to first API call from 2 hours to 30 minutes<br/>• Increase documentation satisfaction score from 7.2 to 8.5 out of 10<br/>• Achieve 90% resolution rate for developer support tickets within 24 hours |
| **Platform Evolution** | • Drive API adoption from 100k to 500k monthly calls<br/>• Launch 3 new SDKs with 50+ stars each on GitHub<br/>• Achieve 80% developer satisfaction rating for new platform features |

<Callout>
Remember: Your objectives should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) and directly tied to both business outcomes and developer success. Use the [OKRA Framework](/blog/2024-10-29-devrel-team-goal-planning-strategy-okr) to define clear metrics, actions, and timelines for each objective.
</Callout>

By setting clear objectives that align with both company goals and developer needs, you create a foundation for a successful DevRel strategy that delivers measurable value to all stakeholders. The key is to balance lead metrics (measuring work output) and lag metrics (measuring outcomes) based on your team composition and organizational structure.

### 2. Understanding Your Developer Audience

<Callout>
"There is no simple single definition for 'Developer.' Rather, it refers to millions of people with differing skill levels and authority, who use different technology stacks and programming languages." - DevRel Book
</Callout>

One of the most common pitfalls in DevRel is saying you're "targeting developers" without further specification. This approach is too broad to be effective. Your developer audience is diverse across multiple dimensions:

- Skill levels and authority
- Technology stacks and programming languages
- Geographic regions and languages
- Company types and sizes
- Career stages
- Use cases and needs

#### 2.1 Developer Segmentation Framework

To effectively understand and target your developer audience, you need a structured approach to segmentation. The framework consists of four key filters:

1. **Technical (Product Focus)**
   - Which programming languages do they use?
   - What technology stack do they work with?
   - What platforms do they develop for?
   - What technical requirements must they meet?

2. **User (Developer Focus)**
   - What is their experience level?
   - What is their decision-making authority?
   - What are their primary responsibilities?
   - What are their technical preferences?

3. **Organization (Customer Focus)**
   - What type of company do they work for?
   - What industry are they in?
   - What is their company's size and stage?
   - What are their use cases?

4. **Market (Industry/Geography Focus)**
   - Which geographic regions are they in?
   - What languages do they speak?
   - What industry regulations affect them?
   - What market trends influence their work?

#### 2.2 Validation Criteria

When defining your segments, each criterion must pass these tests:

1. Is the segment relevant to our business?
2. Is it a large enough segment?
3. Is it a valuable enough segment?
4. Can we target this segment with our current resources?

<Callout type="warning">
"Segmentation is not a one-time exercise. To start, it's most important to focus on your current situation over the next 6 to 12 months. However, what's important today may change in the future." - Caroline Lewko & James Parton, DevRel Book
</Callout>

#### 2.3 Creating Developer Personas

As Tessa Kriesel notes, "Personas are a way to personalize your targets and humanize them. Depending on your segments, you should define 2-4 personas."

alt="Developer Persona Canvas Example" 
width={400}
height={400}
src={DeveloperCanvas}
className="!my-0 rounded-xl bg-fd-background"
priority
/>
*Developer Persona Canvas Example*

Each persona should include:

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Background Information** | • Role and responsibilities<br/>• Years of experience<br/>• Primary technologies used<br/>• Career goals |
| **Technical Profile** | • Preferred programming languages<br/>• Development environment<br/>• Technical decision-making authority<br/>• Tool preferences |
| **Behavioral Patterns** | • How they learn new technologies<br/>• Where they seek information<br/>• Community participation habits<br/>• Decision-making process |
| **Pain Points and Needs** | • Current challenges<br/>• Technical limitations<br/>• Resource constraints<br/>• Learning preferences |

#### 2.4 Developer Positioning

Once you understand your audience, you need to position your product or platform effectively. Answer these key questions:

1. **Value Proposition**
   - What type of product are you offering?
   - What specific problems does it solve?
   - How does it make a developer's life easier?

2. **Differentiation**
   - Why should developers choose your solution?
   - What makes your offering unique?
   - How does it compare to alternatives?

3. **Success Criteria**
   - What does success look like for the developer?
   - How can you help them achieve their goals?
   - What metrics matter to them?

<Callout>
Remember: Your audience understanding should directly inform your content strategy, community approach, and success metrics. Regular reassessment is crucial as developer needs and market conditions evolve.

## Questions from the community

- Building engaged developer communities
- How do you find people that are smart devs, but excited to sell as well

- choosing metrics (set up ones expected to be be different from operational ones)
- hiring (roles, and in what order, and what seniority levels)
- where does devrel sit within the org structure (how to pick a function/ reporting line)
- securing budget (and how to convince that devrel activities are important enough)

Also, if I may speak on behalf of DevRel Uni (cc @bianca_buzea) :
- 30-60-90 day plan

---

## Zero to one: DevRel in 365 days.

example: 
- "Creating an LLM-as-a-Judge That Drives Business Results (51 minute read)" https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/llm-judge/
### Prerequisites

- No DevRel team
- No DevRel budget
- No DevRel plan
- An empty sheet of paper

### Milestones
*
Possible key milestones:

- 1. Content and Education Hub
    - A comprehensive documentation portal covering all the topics a developer would need to know about the product with clear learning paths.
    - A regular content calendar (2-3 quality posts per week) with a mix of tutorials, how-to guides, reference material and more:
        - Deep-dive tutorials
        - How-to guides
        - Case studies of successful implementations
        - Technical best practises and architecture guides
- 2. Active Developer Community
    - A thriving Discord or similar community platform with: 
        - Regular technical offics hours
        - Active peer-to-peer support channels
        - Direct access to the technical team for advanced questions
    - A 'developer champions' program recognizing and rewarding active community contributors. You want to keep your superstars.
- 3. Feedback & Product Development
    - Established feedback loops between developers and the product team.
    - Monthly developer advisory sessions and ways to harvest actionable (!) feedback.
    - A public roadmap influenced by community input. (This is a great way to get developers excited about your product. Make them a part of the process.)
    - Regular beta testing programs for new features (For your superstars)
- 4. Measurable Impact 
    - A working OKR(A) framework in place to measure success.
        - Including factors like 'lagging' and 'leading' metrics to understand the impact of your efforts. You want to rigorously work towards keeping the metrics in the green.
        If you notice constantly lagging/red metrics, you need to ask yourself why and adjust your strategy accordingly asap. Do not hesitate to pivot.
    - Clear KPIs showing:
        - Growth in monthly active developers
        - Increased documentation usage and satisfaction
            - Have tracking metrics in place to measure bounce rates, time spent on page, number of SDK uses, etc.
                - If you see a lot of bounce rates, you need to ask yourself why and adjust your docs. (heat maps will help you here)
        - Higher developer retention
            - Have tracking metrics in place to measure churn rate, number of churned users, etc. (You could even track where the contributors went via their GH profiles.)
        - Improved time-to-hello-world metrics
        - Community engagement metrics
            - Number of comments, number of reactions, number of posts, etc.
- 5. Industry presence 
    - Regular contributions to industry publications
    - Regular speaking engagements
    - Hosting or sponsoring developer events 

The key to achieving this vision will be maintaining a balance between educational content creation, community building, and gathering actionable feedback for our product team. 
Everything will be measured against clear OKRs to ensure we're delivering value both to our developer community and to our company.
