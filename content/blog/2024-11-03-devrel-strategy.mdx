## So, DevRel Strategy?

This is a comprehensive guide to creating and implementing effective Developer Relations strategies.
We've been covering DevRel Strategy in our [Fundamentals](docs/fundamentals/devrel-strategy) section. This post will also use the OKR(A) framework to measure success. You can read more about it [here](/blog/2024-10-29-devrel-team-goal-planning-strategy-okr).

<Callout>
  A well-crafted DevRel strategy is the foundation for building strong relationships between your company and the developer community, driving adoption, and fostering innovation.
</Callout>

Having a well defined strategy, ways to measure it's impact and iterate on it is key to success.

Without a plan in place, you're just shooting in the dark. We don't want that.

## What is a 'DevRel Strategy'?

There is no one definition of what a DevRel Strategy is.
Instead, it's a collection of activities, initiatives and goals that align with the overall objectives of the Developer Relations team.

A DevRel Strategy is:

<Cards>
  <Card
    icon={<Target className="text-purple-300" />}
    title="A Strategic Plan"
  >
    A comprehensive plan outlining how your company will engage with, support, and grow its developer community - from community building to content creation, aligned with business objectives.
  </Card>

  <Card
    icon={<Edit className="text-blue-300" />}
    title="A Living Document"

## The Beginning: Where are we?

### Understanding Where DevRel Sits

Before defining objectives, it's crucial to understand where DevRel sits within your organization. Based on my survey of 30 companies and protocols acting in crypto, web3 and AI, the organizational placement varies significantly:

export const chartDataDevRelCenter= [
  { key: "Marketing", val: 32.1 },
  { key: "Engineering", val: 32.1 },
  { key: "Product Management", val: 14.3 },
  { key: "Own Department", val: 10.7 },
  { key: "Customer Support", val: 7.1 },
  { key: "Growth", val: 3.6 },
];

<PieChart 
   title="Center of Developer Relations in Organizations"
   description="Where do you primarily see Developer Relations centered in your organization?" 
   chartData={chartDataDevRelCenter}
/>

<p className="text-center italic mt-2">Center of Developer Relations in Organizations</p>

The survey results show an even split between *Marketing* and *Engineering* departments as the primary homes for DevRel teams, followed by *Product Management*. Some organizations have established DevRel as its own independent department, while smaller percentages operate within *Customer Support* and *Growth*. 

<Callout>
This distribution highlights that there's no one-size-fits-all approach - DevRel can thrive in different organizational structures depending on company needs and culture.
</Callout>

But how do you know where to put your DevRel team?\
Here are some questions that can help you decide:

- **Do you have a product that needs to be adopted by developers?**\
Maybe you should put DevRel in Engineering to get the developers to use your product and give them the best possible onboarding and enablement experience. Engineers are the ones who build the product after all. And the

- **Do you have a community that needs to be built and nurtured?**\
Maybe you should put DevRel in Marketing and work on content, community and events.

- **Do you have a need for education and enablement of developers?**\
Maybe you should put DevRel in Product Management to create the best possible onboarding and enablement experience.

- **Do you have a need for evangelism and promotion of your product, protocol or company?**\
Maybe you should put them in Marketing to promote it.

- **Do you have a need for technical support and customer success?**\
Maybe you should put them in Customer Support to provide the best possible support to your developers. 

Remember: This is just a starting point to help you understand where DevRel can sit in the org.
We will cover some of these questions in more detail later. 

--- 

### Primary Focus Areas

Okay, so we know where DevRel sits in the org. Now, what are they doing? If you're someone who's been around DevRel for a while, you'll know that the focus areas vary significantly. Many times the people you're talking to will tell you they do "everything" and it's hard to get them to focus on one thing.
This is what you want to avoid. Make sure to focus on what's important for your product, protocol or company.

My research revealed the primary focus areas of Developer Relations teams and you can tell its very diverse:

export const chartDataDevRelFocus = [
  { key: "Community", val: 20 },
  { key: "Content", val: 16.7 },
  { key: "Developer Experience", val: 16.7 },
  { key: "Product", val: 16.7 },
  { key: "Education", val: 13.3 },
  { key: "Evangelism", val: 6.7 },
  { key: "Open-source", val: 3.3 },
  { key: "Other", val: 6.7 },
];

<PieChart 
   title="Primary Focus of Developer Advocacy in Companies"
   description="Which type of Developer Advocacy does your company primarily focus on?" 
   chartData={chartDataDevRelFocus}
/>

<Accordions >
   <Accordion title="Focus Area Explanation (with Description)">
      | Focus Area | Percentage | Description |
      | --- | --- | --- |
      | Community | 20% | Building and nurturing developer communities |
      | Content | 16.7% | Creating technical documentation, tutorials, and educational materials |
      | Developer Experience | 16.7% | Improving the overall developer journey |
      | Product | 16.7% | Focusing on product adoption and feedback |
      | Education | 13.3% | Training and enabling developers |
      | Evangelism | 6.7% | Promoting platform/product adoption |
      | Open-source | 3.3% | Contributing to and managing open-source initiatives |
      | Other | 6.7% | Holistic approaches combining multiple areas |

      Notably, under the 'Other' category, respondents emphasized the importance of taking a holistic approach. They stressed that all areas are highly important and that focusing solely on one aspect neglects the multifaceted nature of Developer Relations.
   </Accordion>
</Accordions>

Okay, but how do you know what to focus on? 
This is where you need to do your research. It's important to understand your audience, your product, your company and your goals.
You need to speak to both, internal stakeholders and external developers. 

- If you're one of the founding members of the company and there is no product yet, you need to focus on education and community.
- If you're a bit further down the line, you can start to focus on evangelism and product.
- And if you're a mature company with a well established product, you can focus on community and content, content, content.

Usually this is one of the first steps in a 30-60-90 day plan, but we'll cover that in more detail later. 

Now we first need to define our objectives.

---

## Chapter One: The Objective

The objective is the foundation of any DevRel strategy. Without clear objectives, you cannot effectively:
- Move forward with coherent initiatives
- Know what you're working towards
- Hire the right people
- Allocate appropriate budget
- Measure success

Your objectives should be specific, measurable, and aligned with both business goals and developer needs. 
In the following sections we will cover how to define your objectives and how to structure them. Let's start with the strategic side of things:

### Setting Strategic Direction

Set sail! You know where to go, right? Oh you don't? Well...

The strategic direction of your DevRel strategy is crucial. It's obvious, right?
Your DevRel objectives need to address at least the following three key areas. Depending on your specific situation you may need to add others, 
but these are a good starting point and should always be considered because they are essential to your success, growth and impact.

| Area | Objectives |
|------|------------|
| Business Impact | • Revenue growth through increased platform adoption<br/>• Market expansion into new developer segments<br/>• Reduced support costs through self-serve resources |
| Developer Success | • Faster time-to-value for new developers<br/>• Higher satisfaction and productivity<br/>• Stronger community engagement and collaboration |
| Platform Evolution | • Product improvements driven by developer feedback<br/>• Enhanced developer experience and tooling<br/>• New use cases and implementations |

Now that we know at least where to go, let's talk about how to get there, which route to take and how long it will take:

### Planning Horizons

Structure your objectives across multiple timeframes. When working on your objectives, you should always consider the impact to later stages.
Try to avoid setting objectives that are too short-term, as this can lead to a **lack of long-term vision**. You don't want to end up with a mess of initiatives that don't align with each other.
But also avoid setting objectives that are too long-term; on the other hand this can lead to a **lack of focus and impact**.

Ah, and btw: **Don't be afraid to pivot!**. If there is one thing I've learned in my career, it's that you need to be flexible and adapt to the situation if something isn't working. If you're not, you'll not move forward. 
You'll lose momentum. You need to be laser focused and can't afford to be distracted by trying to fix what isn't working in the first place.

Let's take a look at some examples. Take these with a grain of salt, they are just meant to give you an idea of how you can structure your objectives. It's important to note that the timeframe can vary significantly depending on your specific situation:

| Timeframe | Objectives |
|-----------|------------|
| **Short-term (0-3 months)** | • Establish baseline metrics and KPIs<br/>• Launch MVP documentation and essential guides<br/>• Set up basic community channels and support<br/>• Create initial "time-to-hello-world" content |
| **Medium-term (3-6 months)** | • Scale developer adoption with targeted programs<br/>• Expand technical content and learning resources<br/>• Build feedback loops with product teams<br/>• Launch developer champions program |
| **Long-term (6-12 months)** | • Create sustainable developer ecosystem<br/>• Drive platform innovation through community feedback<br/>• Establish thought leadership in specific verticals<br/>• Scale successful programs based on metrics |

<Callout type="warn">
In rapidly evolving spaces like crypto, web3, and AI, planning beyond 12 months can be counterproductive. Focus on shorter cycles with frequent reassessment and adjustment of objectives.
</Callout>

### Critical Success Factors

To achieve these objectives, focus on:

#### 1. **Clear Value Proposition**

Your value proposition is the foundation of your DevRel strategy. It's what makes developers want to use your platform, engage with your content, and ultimately become advocates for your product. Without a compelling value prop, you're just another voice in the crowd - and trust me, that crowd is getting louder every day.
Let's break down how to craft a value proposition that actually resonates with developers (and no, "we're the best platform ever" doesn't count). Here's what you need to focus on:

<ImageZoom  
alt="Value Proposition" 
width={400}
height={400}
src={ValueProposition}
className="!my-0 rounded-xl bg-fd-background"
priority
/>
*Value Proposition based on the DevRel Book*

| Focus Area | Key Activities |
|------------|---------------|
| **Articulate Unique Benefits** | • Identify and communicate specific pain points your solution addresses<br/>• Highlight time-saving and efficiency gains<br/>• Demonstrate how your platform/product enhances developer workflow<br/>• Show clear examples of successful implementations<br/>• Provide concrete "before and after" scenarios |
| **Demonstrate ROI** | • Calculate and present cost savings metrics<br/>• Showcase development time reduction<br/>• Highlight resource optimization benefits<br/>• Present case studies with quantifiable results<br/>• Track and report on key performance indicators |
| **Define Success Metrics** | • Set clear adoption metrics and goals<br/>• Establish developer satisfaction benchmarks<br/>• Define engagement KPIs (e.g., active users, API calls)<br/>• Create timeline-based objectives<br/>• Implement feedback loops for continuous improvement |

<Callout>
Remember: Your value proposition should be data-driven and focused on tangible outcomes. As the DevRelBook states: "Data beats fluff" - back up your claims with real metrics and success stories.
</Callout>

#### 2. **Strong Foundations**

Strong foundations are like the bedrock of your DevRel strategy. Without solid documentation, reliable support, and quality educational resources, even the best value proposition will crumble. 
Think of it as building a house - you wouldn't start with the roof, would you? Let's break down what makes for truly robust DevRel foundations.
Here's a detailed look at the key components that will keep your developer relations program standing tall:

<PieChart
  title="Developer Tools & Services Distribution"
  description="What companies offer to developers based on survey data"
  chartData={[
    { key: "Documentation", val: 76.7 },
    { key: "Code Samples", val: 70.0 },
    { key: "APIs", val: 56.7 },
    { key: "SDKs", val: 53.3 },
    { key: "Platforms/BaaS", val: 46.7 },
    { key: "Libraries/Frameworks", val: 43.3 },
    { key: "IDEs", val: 13.3 },
    { key: "Other", val: 10.0 }
  ]}
/>

Based on my research, documentation and code samples are the clear winners here - making up over 70% of what companies offer to developers. 
What's the first thing we all do when checking out a new tool? We hit the docs! APIs and SDKs follow closely behind, showing how companies are really focusing on making their tools developer-friendly.
But it's not just about having them, it's about having them in the right format and making them easily accessible. More on that later.

Here are the key activities you should focus on to build strong foundations:

| Focus Area | Key Activities |
|------------|---------------|
| **Documentation & Tools** | • Create comprehensive API reference docs<br/>• Build developer SDKs and libraries<br/>• Provide code samples and starter templates<br/>• Maintain interactive API playground<br/>• Implement documentation versioning |
| **Support Infrastructure** | • Set up developer forums and communities<br/>• Establish ticketing/issue tracking system<br/>• Create knowledge base and FAQs<br/>• Provide direct support channels<br/>• Monitor support response times |
| **Educational Resources** | • Develop interactive tutorials and guides<br/>• Create video content and webinars<br/>• Write technical blog posts and articles<br/>• Design hands-on workshops<br/>• Build learning paths for different skill levels |

####  3. **Community Investment**

The community is the heart of any DevRel program. It's where developers come to learn, share, and collaborate. 
This is also one of the hardest things to get right, but when done well, it can be a powerful driver for growth and success.
Often times you'll hear 'yeah, we just need to build a community' - but it's not that simple. 
You need to invest in it, you need to nurture it, you need to have a plan for it - and you need to have TIME for it. So carve out time to engage with your community.

| Focus Area | Key Activities |
|------------|---------------|
| **Community Building** | • Foster peer-to-peer learning opportunities<br/>• Create mentorship programs<br/>• Host community events and meetups<br/>• Facilitate knowledge sharing sessions<br/>• Build online discussion spaces |
| **Recognition Programs** | • Implement contributor rewards system<br/>• Highlight community success stories<br/>• Create developer advocacy programs<br/>• Provide speaking opportunities<br/>• Offer exclusive access to beta features |
| **Collaboration Tools** | • Set up community forums<br/>• Enable project collaboration spaces<br/>• Create networking opportunities<br/>• Organize hackathons<br/>• Facilitate code review sessions |

####  4. **Continuous Improvement**

DevRel is all about continuous improvement - you can't just set it and forget it. You need to constantly gather feedback, measure your impact, and adapt your approach based on what you learn.
This is where having good tracking and measurement systems in place becomes crucial. Let's break down the key areas. We will cover this in more detail later.

| Focus Area | Key Activities |
|------------|---------------|
| **Feedback Loops** | • Conduct regular developer surveys<br/>• Host feedback sessions and interviews<br/>• Monitor community discussions<br/>• Track support tickets and issues<br/>• Analyze documentation usage patterns |
| **Metrics & Analytics** | • Track developer adoption metrics<br/>• Measure documentation effectiveness<br/>• Monitor community engagement<br/>• Analyze support response times<br/>• Review developer satisfaction scores |
| **Program Optimization** | • Iterate on documentation based on feedback<br/>• Refine community programs<br/>• Adjust support processes<br/>• Update educational content<br/>• Enhance developer tools |

### Setting Clear Objectives

Now that we've covered how to understand where DevRel sits in the org and what the primary focus areas are, we can define our objectives.
Your DevRel objectives should align with your **company's overall goals** while serving the **developer community**. 

When setting objectives, we can leverage both strategic and tactical frameworks. At a strategic level, **OKRs** help us set ambitious goals, while **SMART** criteria ensure our tactical execution is well-defined.

<Cards>
   <Card title="Objectives" icon={<Target className="text-purple-300" />}>
      Set ambitious, inspirational goals that align with your company's mission and the developer community's needs.
   </Card>
   <Card title="Key Results" icon={<ChartLine className="text-purple-300" />}>
      Define measurable outcomes that will indicate progress toward your objectives.
   </Card>
</Cards>

For tactical execution, let's break down the SMART framework:\
*Let's sing a [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG3UwIDAEb8)*

<Steps>
   <Step>
      #### S is for *Specific*
      Your objective should be specific and clear. It should not be vague or general.
   </Step>
   <Step>
      #### M is for *Measurable*
      Your objective should be measurable. You should be able to track and measure your progress towards the objective.
   </Step>
   <Step>
      #### A is for *Achievable*
      Your objective should be achievable. You should be able to achieve the objective with the resources and capabilities available to you.
   </Step>
   <Step>
      #### R is for *Relevant*
      Your objective should be relevant. It should align with your company's overall goals and the needs of the developer community.
   </Step>
   <Step>
      #### T is for *Time-bound*
      Your objective should have a deadline. You should know when you want to achieve the objective by.
   </Step>
</Steps>

### Defining Your Objectives

With our understanding of SMART objectives and the OKRA framework, let's explore the key strategic questions that will help shape your specific objectives. These questions ensure your objectives are both impactful and achievable:

1. **Company Alignment**
   - How does this objective support the company's current strategic priorities?
   - What specific business metrics will this objective impact?
   - Which stakeholders need to be involved or consulted?
   - How does this align with other departmental goals?

2. **Developer Impact**
   - What tangible benefits will developers gain?
   - How will this improve their workflow or productivity?
   - What pain points are we specifically addressing?
   - How can we validate the impact through both qualitative and quantitative metrics?

3. **Resource Planning**
   - What team capabilities are needed to achieve this objective?
   - What tools or infrastructure must be in place?
   - What timeline is realistic given current resources?
   - What dependencies need to be considered?

<Callout>
Pro tip: Start with 2-3 core objectives rather than trying to tackle everything at once. You can always expand your focus as your program matures and you demonstrate success.
</Callout>

---

### Example Objectives

Let's look at some example strategic objectives for a Developer Relations program. Remember that your specific objectives should align with your company's stage, resources, and goals.
Focus on IMPACTFUL objectives first, expand scope later.


Here are some example strategic objectives across different focus areas:

| Strategic Area | Example Objectives |
|----------------|-------------------|
| **Developer Experience** | • Create a seamless onboarding experience that gets developers to their first success quickly<br/>• Build comprehensive, well-organized documentation and learning resources<br/>• Establish reliable support channels and response processes |
| **Community Building** | • Foster an active, engaged developer community where peers help peers<br/>• Create opportunities for developers to showcase their work and expertise<br/>• Develop programs that recognize and reward community contributors |
| **Product Feedback** | • Build strong feedback loops between developers and product teams<br/>• Ensure developer needs influence product roadmap decisions<br/>• Create channels for early testing and validation of new features |
| **Education & Enablement** | • Develop clear learning paths for different developer segments<br/>• Create content that helps developers solve real-world problems<br/>• Enable developers to become product experts and advocates |

<Callout>
Remember: Your objectives should align with both business goals and developer needs. Start with 2-3 core objectives rather than trying to tackle everything at once. You can expand your focus as your program matures.
</Callout>

These strategic objectives provide direction for your DevRel program. Later in this article, we'll cover how to measure progress against these objectives using the OKRA framework and specific metrics.

![Developer Audience](/images/blog/2024-11-03-devrel-strategy/developer-audience.jpg)
## Chapter Two: Understanding Your Developer Audience

Great. We now know what we're doing and why we're doing it. Now we need to understand who we're doing it for...
One of the most common pitfalls in DevRel is saying you're "targeting developers" without further specification. This approach is too broad to be effective. Your developer audience is diverse across multiple dimensions:
<Cards>
   <Card title="Skill Level & Authority" icon={<UserCog className="text-blue-300" />}>
      From junior developers to technical leads and architects, developers have varying levels of experience and decision-making authority that affect how they interact with your product.
   </Card>

   <Card title="Tech Stack" icon={<Zap className="text-green-300" />}>
      The technologies developers use shape their needs - from programming languages like Python and JavaScript, to frameworks, platforms and infrastructure preferences.
   </Card>

   <Card title="Geography & Language" icon={<Globe className="text-red-300" />}>
      Location matters - developers work across different regional hubs, primary languages, and local tech communities that influence how they engage.
   </Card>

   <Card title="Company Profile" icon={<Building2 className="text-orange-300" />}>
      Whether at startups or enterprises, developers operate in different contexts with varying team sizes, structures and industry-specific requirements.
   </Card>

   <Card title="Career Stage" icon={<GraduationCap className="text-yellow-300" />}>
      Career stage impacts needs and goals - from students and new graduates to career changers and experienced professionals seeking growth.
   </Card>

   <Card title="Use Cases" icon={<Target className="text-purple-300" />}>
      Developers build for different purposes - internal tools, customer-facing applications, or system integration projects each with unique requirements.
   </Card>
</Cards>

<Callout>
"There is no simple single definition for 'Developer.' Rather, it refers to millions of people with differing skill levels and authority, who use different technology stacks and programming languages." - DevRel Book
</Callout>

#### Developer Segmentation Framework

To effectively understand and target your developer audience, you need a structured approach to segmentation. The framework consists of four key filters.
Each filter will help you understand your audience from different perspectives. And remember, you don't have to use all filters for each segment.

| Focus Area | Key Questions |
|------------|---------------|
| **Technical (Product Focus)** | • Which programming languages do they use?<br/>• What technology stack do they work with?<br/>• What platforms do they develop for?<br/>• What technical requirements must they meet? |
| **User (Developer Focus)** | • What is their experience level?<br/>• What is their decision-making authority?<br/>• What are their primary responsibilities?<br/>• What are their technical preferences? |
| **Organization (Customer Focus)** | • What type of company do they work for?<br/>• What industry are they in?<br/>• What is their company's size and stage?<br/>• What are their use cases? |
| **Market (Industry/Geography Focus)** | • Which geographic regions are they in?<br/>• What languages do they speak?<br/>• What industry regulations affect them?<br/>• What market trends influence their work? |

#### Applying the Framework

Great. Now we know how to segment our audience. But where do we get the information from?\
This requires adopting a data-driven, product-focused mindset to gather insights from multiple sources.

Put your Product Manager hat on and start asking questions 🎩

| Source Type | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| **Qualitative Data** | • Community feedback and discussions<br/>• Industry peer insights<br/>• Technical press coverage<br/>• Product team input |
| **Quantitative Data** | • CRM data analysis<br/>• Product usage analytics<br/>• Stack Overflow surveys<br/>• SlashData reports |


For each segment identified in your canvas, you'll want to build a comprehensive understanding of their needs, behaviors, and constraints. 
Consider these key questions to develop a complete picture:


- What motivates them in their work?
- What tools and resources do they currently use?
- What are their skill gaps and learning needs?
- How do they evaluate and make technical decisions?
- What demands compete for their time and attention?
- What constraints affect their work (budget, infrastructure, culture)?
- Where do they typically seek information and community?

<Callout>
Remember: Your segmentation should be specific enough to be actionable but broad enough to represent a viable market opportunity. Don't create segments so narrow that they become impractical to target.
</Callout>

Feel free to use this Developer Segmentation Canvas to help you understand your audience:

   priority
/>

---

#### Validation Criteria

After you've identified your segments, you'll want to challenge and validate their viability by asking these questions.

1. Is the segment relevant to our business?
2. Is it a large enough segment?
3. Is it a valuable enough segment?
4. Can we target this segment with our current resources?

<Callout type="warn">
"Segmentation is not a one-time exercise. To start, it's most important to focus on your current situation over the next 6 to 12 months. However, what's important today may change in the future." - Caroline Lewko & James Parton, DevRel Book

Once you've validated your segments, you can start to create personas.

---

#### Creating Developer Personas

Now that we've identified and validated our segments, it's time to bring them to life through personas. 
Developer personas help us move beyond abstract segments to create realistic representations of our target developers. 
They're not just demographic data points - they're stories that help us understand the humans behind the code. 
They help your entire team align on who you're building for and ensure your strategy resonates with real developer needs.

> Personas are a way to personalize your targets and humanize them. Depending on your segments, you should define 2-4 personas.

*Developer Persona Canvas Example*
(download the blank template [here](/images/blog/2024-11-03-devrel-strategy/developer-persona-canvas.png). Thanks to [DevRel Book](https://www.devrelbook.com/))

Each persona should include:

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Background Information** | • Role and responsibilities<br/>• Years of experience<br/>• Primary technologies used<br/>• Career goals |
| **Technical Profile** | • Preferred programming languages<br/>• Development environment<br/>• Technical decision-making authority<br/>• Tool preferences |
| **Behavioral Patterns** | • How they learn new technologies<br/>• Where they seek information<br/>• Community participation habits<br/>• Decision-making process |
| **Pain Points and Needs** | • Current challenges<br/>• Technical limitations<br/>• Resource constraints<br/>• Learning preferences |


#### Developer Positioning

Once you understand your audience, you need to position your product or platform effectively. Answer these key questions:

1. **Value Proposition**
   - What type of product are you offering?
   - What specific problems does it solve?
   - How does it make a developer's life easier?

2. **Differentiation**
   - Why should developers choose your solution?
   - What makes your offering unique?
   - How does it compare to alternatives?

3. **Success Criteria**
   - What does success look like for the developer?
   - How can you help them achieve their goals?
   - What metrics matter to them?

<Callout>
Remember: Your audience understanding should directly inform your content strategy, community approach, and success metrics. Regular reassessment is crucial as developer needs and market conditions evolve.
</Callout>

#### Key Takeaways

Understanding your developer audience is more than just market research - it's the cornerstone of an effective DevRel strategy. 
We've covered how through proper segmentation, persona development, and positioning, you are able to create a clear picture that informs every aspect of your program.

Let's recap the key takeaways:

<Cards>
   <Card title="Strategic Focus" icon={<Target className="text-purple-300" />}>
      Knowing exactly who you're serving helps prioritize initiatives and allocate resources effectively - no more shooting in the dark with generic "developer" targeting.
   </Card>

   <Card title="Better Engagement" icon={<Handshake className="text-blue-300" />}>
      Detailed personas enable you to create more relevant content, design more effective programs, and build more meaningful relationships with your developer community.
   </Card>

   <Card title="Measurable Impact" icon={<ChartLine className="text-green-300" />}>
      Clear audience understanding helps define success metrics that actually matter to both your developers and your business objectives.
   </Card>
</Cards>

<Callout>
Remember: Your understanding of your developer audience isn't static. Markets evolve, technologies change, and developer needs shift. Regular reassessment of your segments and personas ensures your DevRel strategy stays relevant and effective.
</Callout>

Cool! We've covered a lot of ground. I know some of this is a lot to take in and it might be overwhelming, but don't worry, the puzzle will soon start to come together.
With a solid understanding of who our developers are, we can now move on to mapping their journey - from first discovery to becoming active community members and advocates.

---

![Developer Journey Map](/images/blog/2024-11-03-devrel-strategy/developer-journey.jpg)
## Chapter Three: Developer Journey Map

Now that we understand who our developers are, let's map out their journey. A Developer Journey Map isn't just another fancy marketing tool - it's your blueprint for understanding how developers move from first discovering your product to becoming active users and advocates.

<Callout>
A well-crafted journey map helps you identify where developers get stuck, what resources they need, and when they need them. Without one, you're essentially building a maze and hoping developers find their way through.
</Callout>

### Beyond the Traditional Funnel

Forget the traditional marketing funnel - developer journeys are rarely linear. A developer might jump straight from discovery to implementation, or spend months in evaluation before making a decision. Your job is to support all these paths.

### The Five Stages of the Developer Journey

<DeveloperJourneyStages />

<Callout type="warn">
A developer may complete the first three stages in a single day if you provide a friction-free experience. Conversely, the adoption cycle could take a year if they haven't found the right use case.
**The type of developer product matters** - an API typically has a faster journey time than implementing complex DeFi protocols or zero-knowledge proof systems.
</Callout>

Let's break down the key stages most developers move through. Remember - these aren't rigid boxes, but rather common patterns we see:

| Stage | Goal | Key Questions |
|-------|------|---------------|
| **Discover** | Find potential solutions | • How do I solve my problem?<br/>• What options are available?<br/>• Who else is using this? |
| **Evaluate** | Validate the solution fit | • Will this meet my needs?<br/>• What's the cost/benefit?<br/>• How does it compare to alternatives? |
| **Learn** | Gain practical knowledge | • How do I get started?<br/>• Where's the documentation?<br/>• What resources are available? |
| **Build** | Create working solutions | • How do I implement this?<br/>• What are the best practices?<br/>• Where can I get help? |
| **Scale** | Expand and optimize usage | • How do I grow with this?<br/>• What are the limits?<br/>• How do I optimize costs? |

👀 It's very interesting to see how the 'classic customer journey' map differs from the developer journey map.
I highly recommend reading [Mapping the Customer Journey for Developer Products](https://medium.com/@haleymassa/mapping-the-customer-journey-for-developer-products-9787935997fb) by Haley Massa if you want to learn more.

### Making it Real: Touchpoints That Matter

Every interaction a developer has with your product, documentation, or community is a touchpoint. Some you control, others you don't. Understanding both is crucial:

<Cards>
   <Card title="Owned Touchpoints" icon={<Building2 className="text-blue-300" />}>
      Properties and content that your company controls directly:<br/>
      • Developer portal & documentation<br/>
      • SDKs and sample code<br/>
      • Support channels<br/>
      • Social media presence
   </Card>

   <Card title="External Touchpoints" icon={<Globe className="text-green-300" />}>
      Properties outside your direct control:<br/>
      • Developer-focused media<br/>
      • Third-party communities<br/>
      • Industry forums<br/>
      • Technical blogs
   </Card>
</Cards>

Now that we know what touchpoints are important, let's map out the critical touchpoints for each stage of the developer journey.

---

### Mapping Developer Touchpoints

For each stage of the journey, consider these key touchpoints. 
The following bit will be a bit 'dry' and text heavy, but I promise it's worth it. 
Bookmark this chapter (click on the heading to get a link), come back to it and use it as a reference when planning your touchpoints.

The DevRel Book has a great chapter on this topic, I recommend reading it.
<ImageZoom  
   alt="Developer Journey Map" 
   width={400}
   height={400}
   src={DeveloperJourneyMap}
   className="!my-0 rounded-xl bg-fd-background"
   priority
/>

Let's go through each stage and identify the key touchpoints:

### Discover Stage

<DeveloperJourneyStages stage="discover" />

The discovery stage is where developers first encounter your product, often while actively searching for solutions to their problems. Your presence needs to be visible and compelling across multiple channels.

| Touchpoint | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Search & SEO** | Optimize technical content and documentation for relevant keywords |
| **Social Media** | Maintain active presence on Twitter/X, LinkedIn and other platforms where developers gather |
| **Word-of-Mouth** | Foster organic advocacy through excellent developer experience |
| **Conference Presence** | Share knowledge and showcase solutions at industry events |

### Evaluate Stage

<DeveloperJourneyStages stage="evaluate" />
During evaluation, developers assess if your solution fits their technical requirements, budget, and long-term needs. Transparency and comprehensive information are crucial.

| Touchpoint | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Documentation Quality** | Clear, well-structured docs that demonstrate product capabilities |
| **Getting Started Resources** | Quick-start guides and tutorials that show immediate value |
| **Pricing Transparency** | Clear pricing models with relevant technical limitations |
| **Community Health** | Active community showing product maturity and support |

### Learn Stage

<DeveloperJourneyStages stage="learn" />

The learning stage is critical - developers need resources that help them understand and implement your solution effectively.

| Touchpoint | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Interactive Learning** | Hands-on tutorials and sandboxed environments |
| **API Documentation** | Comprehensive API references with real-world examples |
| **Code Examples** | Production-ready sample code in multiple languages |
| **Developer Support** | Responsive support channels for learning-related questions |

### Build Stage

<DeveloperJourneyStages stage="build" />

During the build phase, developers need reliable tools and support to implement your solution into their projects.

| Touchpoint | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Developer Tools** | Well-maintained SDKs and integration tools |
| **Technical Support** | Quick resolution of implementation challenges |
| **Stack Overflow** | Active presence answering technical questions |
| **Developer Community** | Peer support channels for implementation help |

### Scale Stage

<DeveloperJourneyStages stage="scale" />

As developers scale their usage, they need resources focused on optimization and enterprise-grade implementation.

| Touchpoint | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Success Stories** | Detailed case studies showing successful implementations |
| **Best Practices** | In-depth guides for optimal usage and architecture |
| **Performance** | Documentation on scaling, optimization, and limits |
| **Enterprise Support** | Dedicated support channels for high-value implementations |

---

### Identifying and Removing Friction

Cool, we've mapped out the journey and the touchpoints. Now we need to identify and remove friction points.
In my experience, this is one of the most important parts of the journey map. If you can identify and remove friction points, you'll be able to move developers through the journey much faster and with a better experience.

You can grab the Product Manager hat again 🎩 - but this time you also need some detective skills 🕵️‍♂️.

Follow these steps to identify and remove friction points:
<Steps>
   <Step>
      #### Ask Your Community
      • Conduct regular surveys<br/>
      • Host feedback sessions<br/>
      • Monitor support tickets<br/>
      • Track community discussions
   </Step>
   <Step>
      #### Perform Developer Experience Audits
      • Review onboarding process<br/>
      • Test documentation completeness<br/>
      • Evaluate tool usability<br/>
      • Assess support responsiveness
   </Step>
   <Step>
      #### Measure Journey Data
      • Time to first API call<br/>
      • Documentation bounce rates<br/>
      • Support ticket resolution time<br/>
      • Community engagement metrics
   </Step>
</Steps>

### Key Success Metrics in the Developer Journey

We will cover tracking metrics in more detail later, but for now, make sure to track metrics like these (again, these are examples, you need to adjust them to your specific situation):

| Metric Type | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| **Speed Metrics** | • Time to first successful API call<br/>• Documentation search to solution time<br/>• Support ticket resolution speed |
| **Engagement Metrics** | • Developer portal visits<br/>• Documentation usage<br/>• Community participation<br/>• Support ticket volume |
| **Success Metrics** | • Successful implementations<br/>• API adoption rate<br/>• Developer satisfaction scores<br/>• Community growth |

<Callout>
Remember: Your Developer Journey Map is a living document. Review and update it regularly based on developer feedback, product evolution, and changing market conditions. The goal is continuous optimization of the developer experience.
</Callout>

### Putting It All Together

Now that we've mapped out the journey, let's recap what makes a successful Developer Journey Map:

<Cards>
   <Card title="Flexibility" icon={<Target className="text-purple-300" />}>
      Your map should accommodate different paths and speeds - from the weekend hacker to the enterprise architect evaluating your solution.
   </Card>

   <Card title="Actionability" icon={<ChartLine className="text-green-300" />}>
      Each stage should have clear ownership, metrics, and resources allocated to support developers effectively.
   </Card>

   <Card title="Evolution" icon={<Zap className="text-blue-300" />}>
      As your product and community mature, your journey map should evolve to reflect new patterns and needs.
   </Card>
</Cards>

<Callout>
Pro tip: Start with a simple journey map and iterate based on real developer feedback. It's better to have a basic map that you actually use than a complex one that sits in a drawer.
</Callout>

With our journey map in place, we can now move on to planning the timeline and milestones for implementing our DevRel strategy.

## Chapter Six: [**Measuring Success & Reporting**](#6-measuring-success--reporting)

### Example OKRs

Based on the OKRA framework, here are examples of DevRel objectives with SMART key results. Please note that these are just examples, and you should adjust them to your specific situation. It doesn't make sense to work on SDK adoption if your SDK is just a simple wrapper around an API.
Wait, I need to zoom in a little for this one 🔎:
<div className="text-2xl font-bold text-center my-6 p-4 bg-blue-100 dark:bg-blue-900 rounded-lg">
  Focus on IMPACTFUL activities first, polish the rest later.
</div>

Okay, cool. You get the point. Now back to the examples:

| Objective | Key Results |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Ecosystem Growth** | • Increase developer community members from 1,000 to 5,000 by Q4 2024<br/>• Grow monthly active developers from 100 to 500 by Q3 2024<br/>• Launch developer advocacy program with 10 advocates by Q2 2024 |
| **Internal Advocacy** | • Establish monthly product feedback sessions with 80% engineering team attendance<br/>• Create developer sentiment dashboard tracking NPS with baseline of 30<br/>• Submit 20 validated developer-driven feature requests to product team per quarter |
| **Developer Success** | • Reduce average time to first API call from 2 hours to 30 minutes<br/>• Increase documentation satisfaction score from 7.2 to 8.5 out of 10<br/>• Achieve 90% resolution rate for developer support tickets within 24 hours |
| **Platform Evolution** | • Drive API adoption from 100k to 500k monthly calls<br/>• Launch 3 new SDKs with 50+ stars each on GitHub<br/>• Achieve 80% developer satisfaction rating for new platform features |

<Callout>
Remember: Your OKRs should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) and directly tied to both business outcomes and developer success. Use the [OKRA Framework](/blog/2024-10-29-devrel-team-goal-planning-strategy-okr) to define clear metrics, actions, and timelines for each objective.
</Callout>

By setting clear objectives that align with both company goals and developer needs, you create a foundation for a successful DevRel strategy that delivers measurable value to all stakeholders. The key is to balance lead metrics (measuring work output) and lag metrics (measuring outcomes) based on your team composition and organizational structure.


    - OKR(A) framework
        - If you notice constantly lagging/red metrics, you need to ask yourself why and adjust your strategy accordingly asap. Do not hesitate to pivot.
