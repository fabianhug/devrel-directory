## So, DevRel Strategy?

This is a comprehensive guide to creating and implementing effective Developer Relations strategies.
We've been covering DevRel Strategy in our [Fundamentals](docs/fundamentals/devrel-strategy) section.

<Callout>
  A well-crafted DevRel strategy is the foundation for building strong relationships between your company and the developer community, driving adoption, and fostering innovation.

Having a well defined strategy, ways to measure it's impact and iterate on it is key to success.
Without a plan in place, you're just shooting in the dark. We don't want that.

## What is a 'DevRel Strategy'?

There is no one definition of what a DevRel Strategy is.
Instead, it's a collection of activities, initiatives and goals that align with the overall objectives of the Developer Relations team.

A DevRel Strategy is:

  <Card

    title="A Strategic Plan"

    A comprehensive plan outlining how your company will engage with, support, and grow its developer community - from community building to content creation, aligned with business objectives.
  </Card>

  <Card

    Your strategy evolves as your community grows. Regular reporting and adaptation are crucial, using metrics and community feedback to continuously refine your approach.
  </Card>

  <Card

    title="A Clear Roadmap"
  >
    Maps out specific programs like developer advocacy, hackathons, technical workshops, open-source contributions, and recognition programs to achieve your DevRel objectives.
  </Card>

  <Card

    title="A Success Framework"

    Provides structure through clear objectives, audience understanding, journey mapping, community approach, content strategy, feedback loops, and measurable KPIs.
  </Card>
</Cards>

Great, now we know what a DevRel Strategy is we can start to think about how to create one.

### Key components of a DevRel Strategy

This post will cover the following key components, click on each to jump to the section. 
I highly recommend reading them in order to get a good understanding of the DevRel Strategy process.

1. Objective

This is the first thing you want to get clear on:

- Without a clear objective, there is no way to move forward.
- Without a clear objective, you don't know what you are working towards.
- Without a clear objective, you can't hire the right people.
- Without a clear objective, you can't allocate the right budget.

To get started, you can use the following questions. We will expand on each of them in a bit.

- What is the main goal of the Developer Relations team?
- 


2. Understanding your audience and their needs / Personas
3. Milestones
4. Feedback Loops
5. Measuring Success
    - OKR(A) framework
        - If you notice constantly lagging/red metrics, you need to ask yourself why and adjust your strategy accordingly asap. Do not hesitate to pivot.
6. Developer Journey Mapping
7. Community-Centric Approaches.
    - A 'developer champions' program recognizing and rewarding active community contributors. You want to keep your superstars.
7. Content and Education Strategy
8. Hiring
9. Tools and Tech
10. Budget


## Questions from the community

- Building engaged developer communities
- How do you find people that are smart devs, but excited to sell as well?


- choosing metrics (set up ones expected to be be different from operational ones)
- hiring (roles, and in what order, and what seniority levels)
- where does devrel sit within the org structure (how to pick a function/ reporting line)
- securing budget (and how to convince that devrel activities are important enough)

Also, if I may speak on behalf of DevRel Uni (cc @bianca_buzea) :
- 30-60-90 day plan

## Zero to one: DevRel in 365 days.

### Prerequisites

- No DevRel team
- No DevRel budget
- No DevRel plan
- An empty sheet of paper

### Milestones

Possible key milestones:

- 1. Content and Education Hub
    - A comprehensive documentation portal covering all the topics a developer would need to know about the product with clear learning paths.
    - A regular content calendar (2-3 quality posts per week) with a mix of tutorials, how-to guides, reference material and more:
        - Deep-dive tutorials
        - How-to guides
        - Case studies of successful implementations
        - Technical best practises and architecture guides
- 2. Active Developer Community
    - A thriving Discord or similar community platform with: 
        - Regular technical offics hours
        - Active peer-to-peer support channels
        - Direct access to the technical team for advanced questions
    - A 'developer champions' program recognizing and rewarding active community contributors. You want to keep your superstars.
- 3. Feedback & Product Development
    - Established feedback loops between developers and the product team.
    - Monthly developer advisory sessions and ways to harvest actionable (!) feedback.
    - A public roadmap influenced by community input. (This is a great way to get developers excited about your product. Make them a part of the process.)
    - Regular beta testing programs for new features (For your superstars)
- 4. Measurable Impact 
    - A working OKR(A) framework in place to measure success.
        - Including factors like 'lagging' and 'leading' metrics to understand the impact of your efforts. You want to rigorously work towards keeping the metrics in the green.
        If you notice constantly lagging/red metrics, you need to ask yourself why and adjust your strategy accordingly asap. Do not hesitate to pivot.
    - Clear KPIs showing:
        - Growth in monthly active developers
        - Increased documentation usage and satisfaction
            - Have tracking metrics in place to measure bounce rates, time spent on page, number of SDK uses, etc.
                - If you see a lot of bounce rates, you need to ask yourself why and adjust your docs. (heat maps will help you here)
        - Higher developer retention
            - Have tracking metrics in place to measure churn rate, number of churned users, etc. (You could even track where the contributors went via their GH profiles.)
        - Improved time-to-hello-world metrics
        - Community engagement metrics
            - Number of comments, number of reactions, number of posts, etc.
- 5. Industry presence 
    - Regular contributions to industry publications
    - Regular speaking engagements
    - Hosting or sponsoring developer events 

The key to achieving this vision will be maintaining a balance between educational content creation, community building, and gathering actionable feedback for our product team. 
Everything will be measured against clear OKRs to ensure we're delivering value both to our developer community and to our company.
